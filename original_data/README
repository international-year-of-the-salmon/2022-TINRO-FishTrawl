Notes from Aleksey Somov:

- Salmon_fish samples collected.xlsx - I prepared "Gill_samples.xlsx" file and put some description there, but I didn't create "Salmon_fish samples collected.xlsx". Probably Evgeny did. BTW, NP Scales means that scales were collected from non-preferred area (see section 15 of the cruise plan)

- Gill_samples.xlsx - is the file containing all the information about salmon specimen. Perhaps it worth renaming.

-  Galslist.csv â€“ It is the coordinates of the TINRO reported every 5 min.

- Salmon wounds (photos)  - each photo must contain number of certain fish. Information about wounds/scars/marks is in the "Gill_samples.xlsx" - see column "Marks/scars". Data there is encoded according to the Cruise plan section 14.
